  # UI Development Rules

  ## Documentation First
  - Reference the main UI components documentation in `/src/components/README.md` for context
  - Understand the component organization before creating new components

  ## KISS Principle for UI
  - Start with the simplest UI implementation that works
  - Prefer standard HTML elements and basic styling when possible
  - Only add complexity when necessary for UX improvement
  - Use built-in React features before external libraries

  ## Component Guidelines
  - Use functional components with hooks
  - Define prop types with TypeScript interfaces
  - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
  - Minimize state in UI components - game state belongs in the game engine
  - Use composition over inheritance

  ## Mobile-First Development
  - Design all UI for touch interaction first
  - Use appropriate touch target sizes (min 44x44px)
  - Test on mobile devices or device emulators
  - Consider different screen sizes and orientations

  ## Styling Best Practices
  - Use TailwindCSS for styling
  - Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
  - Follow consistent naming conventions
  - Keep styling simple and performance-focused

  ## Performance Considerations
  - Minimize unnecessary re-renders
  - Use React.memo for pure components when beneficial
  - Lazy load components not needed on initial render
  - Keep an eye on bundle size

  ## Core Components
  - `GameCanvas.tsx` - Main canvas wrapper
  - `TouchControls.tsx` - Mobile touch controls
  - `GameMenu.tsx` - Menu UI
  - UI primitives in the `/ui` subdirectory
