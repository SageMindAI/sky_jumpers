# Sky Jumpers - Technical Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for "Sky Jumpers: The Battle Above the Blocks," a mobile-first web game designed primarily for touchscreen devices and deployable on Vercel. The game features infinite side-scrolling platforming gameplay with procedurally generated levels.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, perfect for Vercel deployment
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience

### Game Engine
- **HTML5 Canvas + Custom Game Loop**: Lightweight approach for 2D platformer games
  - Alternative: **Phaser.js** if more built-in physics and game features are needed

### Styling
- **TailwindCSS**: For UI components outside the game canvas
- **CSS Modules**: For component-specific styling

### Package Management
- **pnpm**: For efficient dependency management with a smaller disk footprint

## Game Mechanics

### Side-Scrolling Implementation
- **Horizontal Camera System**: Camera follows player's horizontal movement while allowing vertical jumps
- **Infinite Level Generation**: Buildings and obstacles are procedurally generated ahead of the player
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Gap distances and platform heights increase gradually as the player progresses
- **Resource Management**: Entities that are no longer visible are removed to conserve memory

### Player Controls
- **Touch Controls**: Implement simple, intuitive touch controls
  - Tap to jump
  - Swipe left/right to move (right swipes produce faster movement to encourage progression)
  - Double-tap for special actions
- **Keyboard Fallback**: Arrow keys and space bar for desktop testing

### Responsive Design
- **Viewport Management**: Use viewport meta tags to ensure proper scaling
- **Flexible Canvas**: Dynamically resize game canvas based on device orientation and screen size
- **Device Detection**: Adapt controls based on input capabilities (touch vs mouse/keyboard)

### Performance
- **Asset Optimization**: Compress sprites and audio
- **Sprite Atlases**: Combine sprites into atlases to reduce HTTP requests
- **Lazy Loading**: Load levels and assets progressively
- **Request Animation Frame**: For smooth animation loop
- **Offscreen Rendering**: Only render entities visible within the viewport
- **Entity Culling**: Remove entities that are far behind the player

## State Management
- **Game State**: Managed within the game engine using a simple state machine
- **App State**: React Context API for UI-related state
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for saving high scores and game progress
- **Distance Tracking**: Score increases based on horizontal distance traveled

## Build and Deployment

### Build Process
- Next.js built-in build system
- Optimize assets during build

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel (seamless integration with Next.js)
- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployments from GitHub

### Environment Variables
- Configure game settings via environment variables for different environments (dev/prod)

## Future Considerations
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Allow installation on mobile devices
- **Analytics**: Implement basic analytics to track player behavior
- **Online Features**: High scores or simple multiplayer if needed
- **Visual Enhancements**: More elaborate backgrounds and parallax effects
- **Advanced Enemy Patterns**: More diverse enemy types with unique movement patterns

## Development Workflow
1. Local development using `pnpm dev`
2. Testing on multiple devices using Vercel Preview Deployments
3. Production deployment via Vercel

This architecture prioritizes simplicity, performance, and a smooth player experience on mobile devices while maintaining an efficient development workflow.
