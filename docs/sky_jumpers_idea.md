# Game Title:
"Sky Jumpers: The Battle Above the Blocks"

## Game Concept:
In a whimsical city of towering blocks and mysterious flying creatures, brave stick-figure heroes must leap from rooftop to rooftop, dodge airborne enemies, and collect power-ups to survive and save their world from a strange solar anomaly!

## Key Elements From the Drawing:
1. **Tall Rectangular Buildings**:
   - These become the main platforms for jumping. Each level could feature different cityscapes with varying building heights and gaps.

2. **Stick Figures in Mid-Air**:
   - These are the player characters! They're agile, fast, and can bounce off springboards or glide across rooftops. Maybe they have jetpacks or grappling hooks?

3. **Flying Creatures (Fish/Bird-like)**:
   - These are the enemies or obstacles. They fly in loops or dive toward players unexpectedly. Some might drop items, others can be dodged or zapped.

4. **Big Flower-Like Sun**:
   - This could be a mysterious source of power—or danger. It pulses with energy and sends shockwaves that players must avoid or use to their advantage.

5. **Floating Objects and Energy Lines**:
   - These could be boost pads or magnetic beams that sling players forward when timed right.

## Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Jump, dash, or grapple** between buildings.
- **Collect floating orbs** to gain energy or upgrade abilities.
- **Avoid enemy attacks** or zap enemies with quick reflexes.
- **Compete or co-op** with friends for the highest score or to complete missions.

## Art Style:
Keep the hand-drawn aesthetic! Think "Crayon Shin-Chan meets Celeste"—a mix of whimsical lines and dynamic platformer animation. You could even animate it so it feels like it's drawn live as you play.
